			<h1>QuikThru</h1>
			<p>
				In the summer of 2018 I took a course on Design Thinking, where
				we learned about and practiced the three main steps of design:
				<ul>
					<li>Inspiration</li>
					<li>Ideation</li>
					<li>Implementation</li>
				</ul>
				The final assignment for the course involved making a prototype
				of a solution to some problem you noticed in the world. <br>
				I made a <a href="https://paulinebennett96.wixsite.com/quikthru">website</a> 
				revolving around fixing how digital boards are currently being used.
				I got anonymous feedback regarding my prototype and made a 
				<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18UWXuKwUMwpSCe9aCfeWuia-BNTbqunF?usp=sharing">
				report</a> about those results.

			<h1>Hackathons</h1>
			<h2>F.*</h2>
			<p>
				On December 1st, 2018, I attended MLH's Local Hack Day. At the 12-hour-long hackathon 
				I got started on an idea of making a find in page (Ctrl+F) Google Chrome Extension that 
				could perform regular expressions on the content of a page. I went about this project
				solo and didn't complete it during the hackathon. I'm hoping to working on it here and
				there in my free time. Here is the <a href="">GitHub</a> for it.

			<h2>FreeDOM</h2>

			<p>
				Back in 2016, I went to McHacks with a couple of friends and 
				we made a Google Chrome extension called FreeDOM.<br> 
				The extension edits the appearance (or disappearance!) of any 
				element within a webpage.<br>
				This could be useful to hide ads, enlarge/highlight the font of a 
				section of the page before printing, etc.<br>
